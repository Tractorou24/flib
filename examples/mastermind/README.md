This is a simple implementation of the game Mastermind. The game is played by one player. The player has to guess a secret code consisting of four different colors.

The colors are chosen randomly from a set of six colors. The player has ten tries to guess the code.

The game ends when the player guesses the code or when the player runs out of tries.
